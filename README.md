# Lux

The purpose of Lux is to _shed light_ into your financial life. It accomplishes
this by providing a common interface to your various financial data sources such as bank accounts, credit cards, investments, etc.

The purpose of this project is to build an open-source system of applications and libraries for fulfilling Lux's purpose.

> _Disclaimer: I have not developed any production systems in Rust prior to this project so I expect high churn/refactors later and many violations of Rust
> style/conventions along the way as I learn to use the language effectively._
